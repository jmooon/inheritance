Create individual classes for all shapes

Main class:
Define variables (length, breadth, radius, a, b, c, side)
Create empty methods for the subclasses to use
  class to hold variables, class for area calculation, class for perimeter calculation
  Ask user what shape they would like
    Use a while loop and boolean to make sure that the input is valid
  Print calculations done from individual classes
  
Rectangle class
  Ask for length and width
  Calculate area (l*w)
  Calculate perimeter (2*l+2*w)

Triangle class
  Ask for base and height
  Ask for side a, b and c
  Calculate area (b*h/2)
  Calculate perimeter (a+b+c)

Circle class
  Ask for radius
  Calculate area (pi*r*r)
  Calculate perimeter (2*pi*r)
  
Parallelogram class
  Ask for base and height
  Ask for side length
  Calculate area (b*h)
  Calculate perimeter (2*(b+side))
