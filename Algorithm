1. Start
2. Create objects for the individual shapes
3. Ask user which shape that they would like to calculate area + perimeter for
4. Get user input for the information depending on the shape that they chose (e.g. length + width for rectangle)
5. Calculate area and perimeter, override variables from main class and use in the sub classes (shape classes)
6. Print the area and perimeter
